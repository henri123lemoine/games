	// De Boer (2007) suggested a formula
	// for the relative values of pieces in Stratego:
	// • The Flag has the highest value of all
	// • The Spy’s value is half of the value of the Marshal
	// • If the opponent has the Spy in play,
	//	the value of the Marshal is multiplied with 0.8
	// • When the player has less than three Miners,
	//	the value of the Miners is multiplied with 4 − #left.
	// • The same holds for the Scouts
	// • Bombs have half the value of the strongest piece
	//	of the opponent on the board
	// • The value of every piece is incremented with 1/#left
	//	to increase their importance when only a few are left
	//
	// A.F.C Arts (2010) used the following value relations:
	// • First feature is multiplying the value of the Marshal
	//	(both player and opponent) with 0.8 if the
	//	opponent has a Spy on the game board.
	// • Second feature multiplies the value of the Miners with 4 − #left
	//	if the number of Miners is less than three.
	// • Third feature sets the value of the Bomb
	//	to half the value of the piece with the highest value.
	// • Fourth feature sets divides the value of the Marshal by two
	//	if the opponent has a Spy on the board.
	// • Fifth feature gives a penalty to pieces
	//	that are known to the opponent
	// • Sixth feature increases the value of a piece
	//	when the player has a more pieces of the same type
	//	than the opponent.
	//
	// Eventually the value of a piece is multiplied
	//	with the number of times that the piece is on the board,
	//	and summated over all the pieces.
	// Values are based upon the M.Sc. thesis by Stengard (2006).
	//
	//
	// In this implementation:
	// • Each of the lowest ranked pieces (1-5) is worth two of
	//	the next lowest rank.  (While this may not be accurate
	//	for competitive human play, it seems to hold true
	//	for AI play, because the loss of any of its low ranking
	//	pieces means almost certain loss once the remaining
	//	pieces are traded off.)
	// • If the opponent has the Spy in play,
	//	the value of the Marshal is multiplied by 0.9.
	// • An unknown piece is worth more than a known piece (stealth).
	// • If a player no longer has any pieces of rank N
	//	and rank N-1, the value of the opponent's rank N-1 becomes
	//	equal to Math.min(value(N), value(N-1)), because pieces of
	//	both rank N and N-1 have the same strength.
	// • Known bombs are worthless, except if they surround a flag.
	//	These bombs are worth a little more than a Miner.
	// • A Spy is the least valuable piece but the highest stealth.
    //  The stealth value is between the value of a Colonel and a
	//	Major.  It is obviously worth more than a Major, which
	//	can be lost and still the game can be won.  But
	//	losing a Three makes it much harder for the AI to win.
	//	However, once the Spy is suspected,
	//	it has limited value except in certain reduced piece
	//	endgames with Ones.
	// • The Nine is the lowest valued piece on the board.  However,
	//	its stealth value is higher than ranks Six and Seven.
	//	High stealth value encourages the Nine
	//	to maintain its stealth by moving only square at a time.
	//	An unmoved Nine should attack a suspected One, Two or
	//	or Three, so its combined value (value + unmoved state
	//	+ stealth) must be less than the stealth of the attacked
	//	low ranked piece.  A known Nine should attack a suspected
	//	Four.
	// • The value of a Miner varies depending on the number
	//	of possible opponent bombed structures remaining.
	//	When there are less Miners than structures,
	//	a known Miner is about equal to a known Six.
	//	Otherwise the Miner is expendable and is worth less than
	//	a Seven.
	// • If the AI is winning, an AI piece is worth less than
	//	the opponents piece of the same rank.  If the AI is losing,
	//	its pieces are worth more.
	// • An unbombed flag is worth about a known Three.  (It is not
	//	the highest value because of the opponent never really
	//	knows for sure the location of the flag.  See the code
	//	for more information).
	// 
	// Note that known Sevens and Nines have very little value,
	// and the AI should sacrifice these pieces by approaching
	// unknown opponent pieces, because the possibility of gaining
	// almost any discovery exceeds their value.  If the AI is
	// winning (and therefore its pieces are reduced in value)
	// a known Seven (or Nine) should sacrifice itself
	// to reveal a suspected Four but not a suspected Five.

	// Perhaps the key and most complex decision in Stratego is whether
	// to lose stealth and capture a piece.  The decision is based on the
	// probability of capturing a yet lower ranked piece or preventing
	// the capture of one of its lower ranked pieces by maintaining
	// continued stealth.
	//
	// For example, an unknown Marshal should not take a Four
	// (if the opponent still has a Two and two Threes),
	// but certainly a Three is tempting.
	// An unknown General should not take a Five, but a Four
	// would be tempting.
	//
	// I have seesawed on whether an unknown Marshal
	// should take a Three.  If it takes a Three,
	// it makes the opponent Two invincible.
	// But if won't take a Three, then the opponent Threes
	// become defacto invincible once the Two is known.
	//
	// The decision on whether to take the Three
	// rests on how vulnerable the AI's position is to attack
	// by an invincible opponent Two.  If the AI has few moved pieces,
	// its Threes are unknown, and the AI Two is unknown and well
	// located for defense, taking a Three is advisable.
	//
	// However, an unknown AI One will always attack a Three
	// once any of the Twos or any of the Threes
	// are gone from the board.
	//
	// An unknown General will attack a Four only if a couple of
	// Threes are gone from the board.  (If the opponent makes a foray
	// with a Four, the AI relies on the fact that it has 2 Threes
	// and 3 Fours to repulse the attack).
	//
	// Stealth value for pieces (1-4) is slightly less than
	// the sum of next six higher ranked pieces still on the board
	// times a risk factor if stealth is maintained.
	//
	// The risk factor is 10%, which is the probability
	// of capture of each of these pieces.
	//
	// If the piece is the only player piece that prevents an opponent
	// piece from becoming a dangerous rank, the value is increased
	// by 1/3.  If there are more than one player pieces, the value is
	// decreased by 1/3.
	//
	// Stealth of a low ranked piece decreases the less chance
	// it has for capture a less valuable piece.
	// For example, if the Ones are still on the board, the
	// Twos have been removed, the stealth of the One
	// drops in half.
	//
	// A One stealth value is equal to 6400 *.1 (640 +- 213 points)
	// if both Twos and all the Threes are still on the board.
	//
	// A Two stealth value is equal to 4000 *.1 (400 +- 133 points)
	// if all Threes and two of the Fours are still on the board.
	//
	// A Three stealth value is equal to 2400 *.1 (240 +- 80 points)
	// if six Fours are still on the board.
	//
	// A Four stealth value is equal to 1200 * .1 (120 +- 40 points)
	// if six Fives are still on the board.
	//
	// Stealth value for pieces (6-9) derives not from opponent piece value,
	// but from opponent stealth value and bluffing.
	// Stealth value increases with increasing rank.  For example,
	// a known Nine has little value, particularly if the opponent
	// no longer has any Nines, because it almost always loses any attack.
	// Therefore its only value is the stealth value of an opponent piece.
	// An unknown Nine has this value AND the ability to bluff.
	//
	// In the example below, Red Six and Red Seven are unknown
	// and Blue Nine is known.  Red has a choice between R6xB9 and R7xB9.
	// Because the stealth value of a Seven is higher than a Six,
	// Red should play R6xB9.  Thus the Seven remains cloaked and
	// can bluff whereas known Red Six is slightly more of a deterrent
	// (and bait) to opponent pieces than a Red Seven.
	// R6 B9 R7
	//
	// Thus, the AI intends to keep its lower ranked and higher ranked
	// pieces cloaked while using its middle pieces for fighting.
	// Stealth value for 5-9 is:
	//
	// If a piece is invincible without compare (it always wins
	// any attack), it has no stealth, because we want to encourage
	// the AI to use it to clean up the last remaining opponent
	// pieces on the board.
	//
	// Stealth value of opponent pieces is calculated somewhat
	// differently.  One can argue that because the ai
	// already has guessed the rank, that the piece would have
	// less stealth value, but because the ai cannot
	// rely on the guessed rank and because of the importance
	// of identifying low ranked pieces accurately, stealth
	// is still very important.
	//
	// The AI should not risk its more valuable pieces on 
	// just to discover the actual rank of an opponent piece.
	// For example, if Red Four has a chance to attack an unknown
	// Blue that it suspects is a One, it should flee and leave
	// the discovery to a lesser piece.
	//
	// The important ranks to discover are Ones, Twos and Threes.
	// Often, these suspected ranks can be confused, so there is not
	// much difference in stealth between them.
	//
	// For example,
	// B? B5 R4
	// The AI should not play R4XB5 if B? is a suspected Two,
	// (This is the same if B? is unknown, see unknownValue())
	//
	// For example,
	// B? B6 R5
	// The AI should not play R5XB6 if B? is a suspected Four.
	//
	// (In the same example, if B? is unknown, the AI would
	// not play R5XR6.)

	// (This situation can happen if B6 is protected
	// by more than one piece,
	// so the protectors do not obtain a suspected rank.)

	// Higher ranked pieces (known 6 and unknown 7,9) will be eager
	// to sacrifice themselves to discover ranks (1-2) and the
	// ranks (known 7 and unknown 9) are eager to discover a Three.

	// Note that this changes based on blufferRisk.  As blufferRisk
	// increases, the AI is more willing to attack suspected
	// rank pieces to confirm their identify.  At low blufferRisk,
	// why bother?

	// Another area where stealth values are important is in
	// unknownValue().  If an AI Four has a choice between
	// an exchange with a suspected rank of Three or an Unknown,
	// the difference is the Three stealth or Two stealth, so
	// the Four will be inclined to take its chances with the Unknown.

		// So to be consistent with the

		// leaves the suspected One unknown.   So in an endgame
		// where the opponent has two unknown pieces (the suspected
		// One and say a Seven buried in a bomb structure),
		// the AI Spy must be bold enough to approach the suspected One
		// and attack it if possible; othewise the game would
		// end in a draw.
		//
		// For the AI Spy to attack the suspected One, the
		// suspected One value must be greater than the AI Spy
		// stealth value (see WINS).   This happens in two ways.
		// (1) The stealth value of AI Spy is tied to the value of the opponent
		// Three (see adjustPieceValues(), and so
		// drops as AI Threes and Fours are removed
		// from the board.   (2) The suspected value of the opponent One
		// increases with moves (see actualValue()).
		//
		// TBD: These kind of endgames may need to be handled
		// in a more specific way, such as a database of endings.

	// And the more the AI is winning, the more risk

	// in circles, so that the AI cannot guess the identity
	// of the remaining pieces or the location of the flag.
	//
	// Thus the wining AI has to be encouraged to enter into
	// questionable exchanges, where it knows it will likely
	// lose material.  The hope is that it has sufficient
	// material advantage that discovery will eventually
	// lead to victory.
	//
	// But not too much more so it allows lower ranks
	// to be captured for higher ranks.  For example,

	// a close exchange, because the AI gets the value of
	// the Four (200) and the stealth value of the Two
	// in exchange for its Three (400).
	//
	// So it is important that the stealth value of the
	// opponent suspected pieces diminish as pieces are
	// removed from the board.  But we still want to encourage
	// the AI to attack unknowns so that it might be able to
	// discover opponent pieces that would allow its pieces

	//
	// TBD: Completely unknown pieces need to be targeted,
	// such as unmoved pieces or those that appear to be

        // such as chasing higher
		// ranked pieces or protecting an open lane.   Furthermore,
		// attackLanes() pushes pieces down the lane to bait the
		// opponent into attacking as well.

		// Therefore prior to Version 13, chasing unknown pieces was limited
        // to expendables chasing non-weak pieces and pieces
        // in the foray lane.  Version 13 seeks to stop random chases

		// and all the pieces of the rank will chase an opponent piece.
		//
		// Because lower ranks are often oversubscribed,
		// a secondary plan B is used that applies
		// to the non-active piece of the rank.
		// For example, this allows one Three to protect
		// the flag, while the other chases opponent
		// pieces, or attacks the opponent flag.
		//
		// Because the ai does not evaluate if
		// the chase will be worthwhile, it does not
		// call genNeededPlanA or B, because that would
		// cause it to move its low ranked pieces
		// which could then become subject to attack by
		// the opponent.
		//
		// A piece can be called up for the chase by
		// calling getNeededPlanA or B 
		// only if the piece is a known invincible piece,
		// the piece is an invincible win piece,
		// or there is only one lower opponent piece of lower
		// known rank remaining and the value of the chased piece
		// is worthwhile to lose stealth to capture.
		//
		// This last condition requires an example.
		// The AI has an unknown invincible Two and the
		// opponent One is known.   The opponent has a known Three
		// or a known Four. This code will move the Two to chase
		// the Three or Four. It will not move the Two to chase
		// a lesser valued piece.
		//
		// It is best not to chase a Two or Three with an unknown One
		// even if the Spy is off the board because if the One
		// is discovered (or guessed because it chased the Two),
		// then the Two becomes invincible.
		// So defensively, keep the One unknown as long as possible.
		// Once it becomes known, then it can chase the Two.
		//
		// On the other hand, an opponent Two or Three
		// can still cause havoc
		// even if the AI One is unknown.  The Two can chase known
		// pieces and block lanes.  So the Two needs to be chased
		// by expendable pieces posing as the One and the One needs
		// to approach the Two, but not chase it, aiming to
		// use the expendable pieces posing as Ones to force
		// the Two to flee towards it.  In addition, the One must
		// always be shielded by other pieces to prevent its
		// discovery.  In the AI implementation, the chase of
		// a known Two by an unknown One
		// is limited to its side of the board.
		//
		// Note that this defensive strategy limits discovery of
		// the opponent Spy.  It is unlikely that the Spy will move
		// to the opposite side of the board if the opponent One
		// is still unknown.  Because the chase is limited to
		// the player's side of the board, indirect discovery of
		// the Spy would not occur.  Thus, the AI does need to
		// send its expendable pieces to chase the Two (and
		// occasionally the One to maintain the bluff) to the
		// opposite side of the board.
		//
		// Ideally, the ai would predict if a chase
		// would be successful, and the only way I know
		// of doing that is to use the search tree.
		// So this code is the best that the ai can do.

		//
		// But there are situations where the opponent will weigh
		// the risk of taking an unknown piece.  In the diagram below,
		// all pieces are unknown.  Red 3 moves to the empty square
		// above Blue 2. Blue guesses that the Red 3 is probably not
		// not an unknown Red One, because Blue has already guessed
		// that Red One is some other piece.  Blue has also guessed
		// that Red 3 is acting like a low ranked piece.
		// So Blue Two takes Red 3 and wins.

		// -- R3
		// B2 B8
		// 
		// This could also turn out to be loss if Red 3 turned out
		// to be a Red 9, because Blue 2 loses stealth.
		// Or if Red 3 really was Red 1.
		//
		// So the situation can be difficult to assess.  Human players
		// may be better able to assess the risk, so it is best
		// for the ai to avoid unknown exchanges.
		//
		// Probability based strictly on remaining piece ranks
		// and number is of little use because piece encounters
		// are rarely random.  A common example is:
		// R2
		// B3
		// B? B? B? B?
		// B? B? B? B?
		//
		// Red has the move.  Should it take B3?  Based on strict
		// random probability, it should, because there is only
		// one One and eight other unknowns in the field, so there
		// is only a small random chance that the unknown blue
		// adjacent to Blue Three is Blue One.  But because Blue
		// has left its Blue Three subject to attack, it is likely
		// that Blue Three IS protected by Blue One.
		//
		// So in an unknown exchange, the AI always loses
		// its actual piece value but gains the
		// the stealth value of the piece that attacks it
		// 
		// For example,
		// xxxxxxx
		// x R4 --
		// x B3 B?
		// Red Four and Blue Three are known.  Red Four will move
		// towards Unknown Blue because at least it will gain
		// the stealth value of Unknown Blue.
		//
		// But if Blue Three was also unknown, the choice is
		// a toss-up between unknowns.  If Red Four stays, B?(3)xR4
		// is a WIN and all Red gains is the stealth value of
		// a Three.  So Red Four will move towards
		// the other unknown because it has the chance to
		// gain a greater stealth value, because the unknown piece
		// could be a One or Two.
		//
		// Red Two should not take a Blue Three if it is protected
		// and Blue One is unknown.  Blue Three is worth 200 points.
		// So B?xR2 must be less than -200.
		// The stealth value of a One (60) plus 10 is 70,
		// so B?xR2 is 70 - 400,
		// or -330 so Red Two will not take Blue Three
		// if it is protected and Blue One is unknown.
		//
		// Another common example is a unknown piece chasing a Two.
		// B? R2 -- --
		// -- -- B? B?
		// B? B? B? B?
		//
		// Governed by the same rule, should Red Two
		// assume that the chaser is Blue One and flee past the
		// unknowns?   If Red Two stays, it loses 400 - 60 but
		// if moves, it loses 400 - 70.  This is a mere 10 points.
		// If Red can capture a piece elsewhere on the board,
		// it will and let its Two be attacked.
		//
		// However, because unknown Blue has chased Red Two,
		// Red now suspects that unknown Blue IS Blue One, making
		// Red Two invincible.
		// This could allow Red Two to flee past the other unknowns
		// with impunity.
		//
		// TBD: there needs to be some risk that a suspected
		// chase piece is not a One.
		//
		// Another borderline example is 4x5 when 5 is protected
		// by two unknowns, so the protectors do not have any
		// suspected rank.  This gains 50 points and the

		// | -- -- -- -- -- -- --
		// | BB R3 -- -- -- -- B1
		// | B4 -- BB -- -- -- --
		// -----------------------
		// Red Three must move to attack Blue Four now because
		// if it plays some other move, it cannot win Blue Four
		// without losing its Three to Blue One in 12 ply.
		//
		// These examples have occurred in play.
		//
		// Up to Version 10.4, the AI would add a credit for
		// positive values and debit negative values the earlier
		// they occurred in the search tree.
		//
		// This credit/debit failed to work properly, because
		// the transposition table makes all positions equivalent,
		// no matter when the moves occur.   The only way to make these positions
		// not equivalent is to change the hash.
		//
		// This is done correctly in the bluffing code,
		// by changing which pieces survive during an attack,
		// so the bluffing code can condition based on depth.
		//
		// But if the hash doesn't change, then it is pointless to
		// bonus or credit the move based on depth or other factors.
		//
		// For example, OPP X unknown AI piece is not the same
		// as unknown AI piece X OPP.   This is a bug if the pieces
		// retained on the board after the attack do not differ.
		// So when the AI piece is an unknown One,
		// the AI piece can be retained in both cases, leading to
		// a cache transparency bug.
		//
		// TBD: This problem will need to be addressed, perhaps by
		// adding or reusing a piece flag that is used by the hash.
		//
		// Version 11 credits positive earlier attacks
		// and modifies the hash for all attacks.
		//
		// Modifying the hash was necessary to enable this
		// credit and because distanceFactor()
		// reduces risk for attacks based on distance.
		// For example:
		// xxxxxxxx
		// -- -- --
		// -- -- -- 
		// -- r? --
		// r1 B9 --
		// Unknown Red One could be attacked by Blue Nine
		// and lose its stealth.  distanceFactor() is 1.
		// But if Red One moves away and Blue Nine chases
		// during the tree search, distanceFactor increases
		// because the probability of attack decreases
		// (will Blue Nine continually chase unknown Red
		// or will it attack some other unknown?).
		//
		// Note: it is impossible to determine what moves
		// the opponent actually considers, so the AI cannot
		// second-guess the opponent and play a suboptimal move,
		// hoping the opponent will miss a good move.

	// R?xB1 (LOSES) is very positive for Red in the move tree,
	//
	// This is why the AI does not currently assign value to the
	// the loss of its piece in LOSES during an effective bluff.
	// Any unknown piece would work.
	//
	// (TBD: But this causes the AI to make many high stakes and unnecessary
	// bluffs, so perhaps it should assign a small negative value,
	// based on the value of its piece, perhaps randomized).
	//
	// The AI must also risk its Spy occcasionally
	// if it wants to convince the
	// opponent that the unknown piece might be the Spy.
	// So B1xRS (WINS) followed by R?xB1 (LOSES) must at least sometimes
	// be positive.  WINS loses the Spy value.  So LOSES must
	// check the prior move.  If the prior move was a capture
	// to the target square, the captured piece value must be
	// negated.
	//
	// The AI doesn't have any clue *why* it is bluffing.  Its
	// only plan is to persuade the opponent into making a bad decision,
	// like moving into the arms of one of its lower ranked pieces
	// or attacking one of its unmoved pieces that could be
	// a bomb.  But this often backfires, if none of its pieces
	// are bombs, and the bluffing AI piece chases the opponent
	// piece through a field of its unmoved pieces, obliterating them.
	//
	// (TBD: can the search tree be used to increase the value of
	// a bluff if it leads to more possibilities of capture?
	// So a bluff that pushes the opponent piece towards a waiting
	// lower ranked piece or a bomb has more bluffing value?)
	//
	// The bluffing value must be less than the lowest value of
	// one of its pieces.  Otherwise the AI will sacrifice
	// bluffing pieces on the front line to repeat the bluff again.
	// For example:
	// xx R? R? xx
	// xx R? R? xx
	// B? -- B1 B?
	// B? B? B? B?
	// Red has the move.  R?xB1 loses its piece.  But if the
	// bluffing value for the approach of a red Unknown further back is 
	// is greater than the piece value, it will play R?xB1 just
	// to be able to move its other unknown piece towards Blue One.
	//
	// On the other hand, a low bluffing value often results in
	// no bluff at all if the opponent has a chase move at its
	// disposal.  For example:
	// -- -- -- -- -- R?
	// R4 -- xx xx B3 --
	// -- -- xx xx -- R?
	// B? -- -- -- -- --
	// The lower unknown Red is a Two.  Red should move the upper
	// unknown left to bluff an attack on Blue Three, which often
	// will move away (and then be captured by unknown Red Two.
	// But if Red only gets a small value for R?xB3, unknown
	// Blue can move upwards towards Red Four.  Then R?xB3 is dwarfed
	// by B?xR4.  So R4 must move away.  After that, the bluff is no
	// longer effective, so B3xR? wins the bluffing piece.
	//
	// To counteract, if the opponent move is a chase move,
	// the bluff must retain its effectiveness.
	// 
	// How it works.
	// Example:
	// R? R5
	// -- B3
	// Blue Three takes Red Five which is protected by
	// unknown Red.  Unknown Red is a Six, so 6x3 is a loss.
	// prev1 is the current move, R6xB3.
	// prev2 is B3xR5.
	// prev1.value is the value of the board after B3xR5.
	// prev2.value is the value of the board before B3xR5.
	// prev1.value - prev2.value is the value(-) of B3xR5.
	// 
	// This works no matter how deep in the move tree.
	// For example,
	// R? -- R5
	// -- B3 --
	// Red Five moves towards unknown Red.  The board is
	// then evaluated as in the above example.

	// the flag after a bomb is removed by the eight, then

	// Still there must be an incentive to remove them
	// because the search tree depth is limited and eventually
	// it is hoped that an exposed flag can be attacked.
	//
	// A flag bomb must always be worth more than an unknown Miner,
	// so that the Miner can sacrifice itself against a defended
	// bomb structure.
	//
	// But the value of an Miner fluctuates depending on the
	// the number of bomb structures remaining (expendable eights).
	// So if the opponent has expendable eights, is the flag
	// bomb worth less?
	//
	// The question comes down to how much the player is willing
	// to spend for defending a flag bomb structure.  This is
	// a difficult question to answer outright, because it depends
	// on the position.  And the player should not defend
	// the flag bomb structure any more actively than another
	// structure; otherwise, the opponent will readily guess
	// the real flag structure.
	//
	// A worthwhile bomb of "color" is worth the value
	// of the AI Miner, its stealth value, and more.
	// This makes attacking or defending a worthwhile bomb always
    // worth sacrificing an AI eight if necessary.  Thus, even
    // if the opponent has expendable Miners, the AI will still
    // sacrifice its miner to protect its bomb structure.
	//
    // A worthwhile bomb must also be worth more than the opponent AI
    // Miner.  Otherwise, the AI will may allow an unknown piece to
    // attack a flag bomb, to prove it is a Miner so that it can attack
    // it with a superior (or expendable Miner) and gain its high value.
    // (A more accurate approach would be to decrease the value of Miners after
    // one attacks a flag structure, but this is just more complexity to
    // save/restore in the tree).
    // 
	// Note that a known miner taking a worthless bomb,
	// the value is zero, but an unknown miner,
	// the value is -stealthvalue.  This deters an
	// unknown miner from taking a worthless bomb.
	// This is calculated in WINS.

	// A small bonus is added if the bomb is surrounded
	// by other pieces.   The idea is to attack bombs that
	// could be part of multiple structures.   For example,
	// B F B -	
	// 7 B - -
	// B - - -
	// Thus the middle bomb is more valuable than either of the end bombs.

	// TBD:  More suspected rank analysis is needed to
	// determine if approaching pieces are Eights.  Most
	// opponents will send expendable pieces or Eights
	// to areas with a suspected bomb structure, rather than
	// low ranked pieces.  The AI needs to examine
	// its known pieces, and track the movement of approaching
	// pieces.  If an approacher is headed towards a Bomb,
	// it is probably an Eight.

    // Note the 4/3 multiplier.  This is needed to encourage a Miner
    // to attack a suspected bomb, because of riskOfLoss.  A Miner WINS
    // a suspected bomb and gains its target value,
    // but risk of loss reduces its gain.  But the Miner
    // stays on the board.  If the bomb is protected by a superior piece,

	// it is possible that the attacker barely reaches
	// the Spy and extended search is insufficient
	// in depth to to prevent the AI from leaving pieces hanging.
	//
	// Note: If the opponent piece is unknown,
	// it is handled in UNK, but because move
	// generation of unknown pieces is limited (pruned off)
	// to 1 space of separation in AI.java,
	// the horizon effect is limited as well.
	// Yet it is still important.
	//
	// Note that the closer the opponent moves towards the AI piece
	// during tree evaluation, the danger does not increase,
	// prediction of moves by unknown pieces is hypothetical.
	// But the closer an AI piece is to an opponent piece at the
	// start of tree evaluation, the higher the probability of attack.
	//
	// Prior to Version 10.4, this was handled by using opponent "moves"
	// (the number of times the opponent piece moved during
	// tree evalution), and not the distance between the two pieces.
	// But this was an error because if the opponent piece moved
	// back and forth during tree evaluation, it increased its number
	// of moves and was deemed less of a threat.
	//
	// Version 10.4 used the distance
	// between the current location of the AI piece and the original
	// location of the opponent piece.
	//
    // But this suffered from the problem of AI pieces fleeing from
    // potential attackers, giving the attacker a clear signal that the
    // piece was a meaty target.  For example:
    // |----------
    // | -- b1 bb
    // | -- R5 --
    // Unknown Blue One is unmoved.  R5xb1 is probable (see apparentRisk)
    // Unknown Blue One moves left because the 10.4 algorithm decreases
    // risk based on its distance to the attacker.  Now Blue has moved
    // and has fled from Red Five, so Red Five is certain it is a
    // worthwhile target.  Furthermore, in this case, Blue One is trapped,
    // making the attack inevitable.
    //
    // So Version 12.1 uses the distance between the original location
    // of the opponent piece and the original OR current location
	// of the AI piece, whichever is less. Now an AI piece cannot flee to
    // avoid the danger; it must call on another piece to defend or just
    // hope that it isn't hit.  Nor can it approach another piece and gain
    // its value without suffering full consequences (such as a One deciding
    // to approach a trapped Two from far away, but seeing only a fraction
    // of the possibility of being attacked the the opponent Spy).

	// TBD: This isn't perfect, because
	// it does not take into account the Lakes, so the AI will sense

		// The risk of attack on an unknown piece is largely

		// 3. multiple targets
		//
		// It is tempting to use depth rather than distance.

		// value assignment applies to suspected ranks as well.
		// So a suspected lower ranked opponent piece  that fled
		// from an AI piece is a positive encounter but not a WIN.

		// it poses no risk to the Six.   Indeed, the surety is
		// that it poses no risk to the Six and it less likely
		// that the piece is actually a Four, and could
		// be almost anything.  Perhaps it is a Three that
		// was willing to attack a Five but is unwilling to
		// be discovered in exchange for a Six?  Perhaps it
		// is a bluffing high ranked piece, like a Seven or

		// This deep analysis is lacking in the assignment

	// when attacked by an unknown piece.
	//

	//
	// A modest aggressive approach is if the AI has already
	// guessed the location of the Spy, it will assume
	// that any other piece is not a Spy.
	//
	// An more aggressive approach is to assume that if
	// the unknown piece has a chase rank other than Spy
	// that the piece is not the Spy.
	//
	// But if the chase rank was awarded by protection
	// rather than actual chase, the chase rank is even less
	// reliable, so if the piece isRankLess() is true, then
	// the AI does not rely on the chase rank.
	// For example,
	// R3 --
	// B4 B?
	//
	// Unknown Red Three approached known Blue Four and it did not
	// move on its turn, so unknown Blue now has a chase
	// rank of Two.  isRankLess() is true, so this is a case
	// where unknown Blue could still be a Spy.
	//
	// Also, a suspected Bomb or Flag might actually be
	// a Spy.  So the One could be lost if a bomb pattern
	// or suspected Flag actually turned out to be a Spy.
	// (NOTE: The One will avoid moving next to a suspected
	// bomb because of bluffing value of Bomb X Piece in LOSES).
	// R1 --
	// -- --
	// BS --
	// BF BB
	//
	// If a piece gains an chase rank of Spy, the One will
	// also avoid it.  For example:
	// B1 -- R1
	// -- BS --
	//
	// Blue Spy moves between Blue One and Red One.  It does
	// this only because Blue is winning and it wants to
	// remove Red One from the board in an exchange, even if
	// it has to sacrifice its Spy (which is worthless anyway
	// with the Ones gone).  Red One must either take the
	// piece or move away.
	//
	// Finally, the most aggressive approach is to rely on
	// setup information.  This is outright guessing, but some
	// bots and players alike assume that the Spy
	// was placed near the Two from the beginning.  If a player
	// always relies on this assumption, then the opponent
	// will learn this strategy in successive games, and then
	// pretty much any neighboring piece to the Two becomes
	// an effective Spy.  So when the AI relies on setup information
	// to determine the Spy location, it only assumes that
	// the Spy is not on the back row.
	//
	// The AI usually opts for the mid aggressive approach because
	// the most aggressive approaches can be learned
	// and then used to defeat the AI (i.e., if the player
	// learns to bluff with its Spy, it can cause the AI
	// to lose its One).
	//
	// Yet if the opponent has a dangerous known or unknown rank,
	// the AI is sure to lose additional material once its
	// One becomes known, so the AI becomes more aggressive.
	//
	// Finally, the AI is aggressive in trying to get the
	// opponent to divulge the location of the Spy.   Thus, once
	// the opponent Two is discovered, the AI chases it with
	// unknown pieces until it either traps the Two between
	// unknown pieces (one of which could the One) or the
	// Two stops with an unknown protector, which the AI then
