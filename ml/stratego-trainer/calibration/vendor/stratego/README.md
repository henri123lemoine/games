# Introduction

Demon Of Ignorance is
a java version of the game of stratego.
This version of the game is forked from cjmalloy/stratego
and mainly offers a much improved AI and some other features.

# Download

[Stratego player v0.13.4][dl]
[dl]: https://github.com/braathwaate/stratego/releases/download/v0.13.4/stratego_v0.13.4.jar

For two person play over TCP/IP, you need the Stratego server,
which you need to make from source.

# Installation and Requirements

Demon Of Ignorance requires java, which you probably already have or can
figure out how to download.

To run on most computers, just double click on the jar file to run.

If that doesn't work, you might need to
make the jar file executable
or set up your computer to select which program opens the jar file.

Finally, you can try to run it from the command line:

	java -jar stratego_v0.13.4.jar

For a more challenging game, click the Settings menu and set the difficulty level to the middle (about 1 second).
For an easier game, keep the difficulty all the way to the left
 and disable the Two Squares rule.

# About the AI (Artificial Intelligence)

The AI algorithm is the generic minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
Iterative deepening, transposition table, heuristic history and killer move are used 
for move ordering to increase pruning success.
Quiescent Search and Extended Search are used to reduce
the horizon effect resulting from a very shallow search depth.
Move generation abides by the Two-Square and More-Squares rules.

The search time is adjustable with the Settings menu.
At the middle difficulty level,
it moves within 1 second
usually completing about 6 ply depending on the speed of the desktop.

The evaluation function is based on material gained versus lost
as well as opponent piece rank discovery.
It weighs which pieces to attack based on the potential
of discovering important piece ranks versus the risk of loss.
Hence, an valuable AI piece will generally avoid unknown and unmoved opponent pieces
whereas lesser AI pieces are eager to sacrifice themselves if the loss
leads to key opponent piece discovery that assists in winning the game.

A primary goal of the AI is to keep its low ranked pieces unknown
while it tries to discover the ranks of the opponent's low ranked pieces,
primarily the opponent's One.
As the opponent's low ranked pieces become known,
the AI's low ranked pieces (Two and up) become locally invincible,
which allow it attack all higher ranked or unknown moved pieces with impunity.

The AI derives opponent piece rank based on how an
opponent piece interacts with its pieces.
When an opponent piece appears to act as a strong chase piece
or protector, the AI tries to attack it with pieces of
expendable rank to confirm its suspicions.

Static position analysis (aka oracle or pre-processing)
is used to determine piece destinations.
Success is largely dependent on the AI in gaining
knowledge of opponent piece rank.
The AI creates plans (using a maze-running algorithm)
to move its pieces towards opponent pieces
where material or informational gain could be possible.
However, because the outcome cannot be determined at this point,
this does lead the AI to make pointless chases
which are mitigated only by the Two-Squares and More-Squares rules.

Once a piece arrives in the general vicinity of its target(s),
the AI relies on the minimax algorithm to find
the optimal set of moves that
allows it to attack its target.
Because every unknown piece is assigned a suspected rank,
every outcome has a single value,
so the generic minimax algorithm is able to determine the optimal result.
The AI is conservative in the assignment of suspected rank,
which results in cautious play until the suspected ranks
are confirmed through attack or mature through extended play.

The result is a stratego bot with a modest amateur level of play,
able to defeat most casual human players and stratego bots.
A primary failing of stratego bots is the lack of bluffing,
which allows the AI to easily determine piece ranks
without random attack.
However, even if the opponent does bluff, the AI does not heavily
weight suspected ranks until confirmed through attack by
a piece of expendable rank.

Areas for improvements are:

## Search tree.
Forward pruning will be required to get to deeper levels.  There is code that forward prunes the search tree for defending against chases.  Can similar code be used to determine attack plans as well?  The AI always abides by the Two Squares rule.  If the Two Squares Settings box is checked, making the opponent abide by the Two Squares rule, then chase attacks would be much more successful and worthy of deep analysis.  Restrict move generation to only those pieces that can affect the outcome.
## Eliminate pointless moves from the search tree.
Pointless moves reduce the effective depth of the search.  For example, a common attack involves a win based on the defender limited out by the Two Squares rule, such as in the example below:
```
B? B? B? |
B? -- B8 |
xx -- -- |
xx -- -- |
R? -- R7 |
```
Red has the move.  Without pointless move reduction, it would take many ply to determine that Red Seven can successfully win Blue Eight.  But with pointless move reduction it only takes a maximum of 8 ply.  This is because after Red Seven moves up, Blue Eight moves left, Red Seven moves left, it is pointless for Blue Eight to move back, because Blue began the Two Squares sequence; moving back cannot change the outcome. So Blue must play some other move.  This is four ply.  Then Red Seven approaches again and the sequence repeats.  Thus the attack is seen to be successful in only 8 ply (not 9, because quiescent search awards the capture at 8 ply).<br><br>This Two Squares case is already coded.  But often the opponent has a pointless chase elsewhere on the board.  By considering the pointless chase, it pushes the player's successful attack past the horizon of the search tree.  So pointless moves need to be removed from the search tree.
## Heuristic.
This has been tuned with countless runs against other bots.  Yet there still much room for improvement.  The heuristic works well against a conservative opponent that doesn't bluff because the AI soon discovers the opponent ranks.  But against an aggressive opponent, the AI (or any player) quickly gains a piece count deficit, and the opponent can turn this into a win, even with a lack of superior pieces.  Indeed, this is the essence of the game of Stratego.  Careful aggression where the player makes educated guesses about the location of the opponents superior pieces, bombs and flag is often rewarded.
## Suspected Rank Analysis.
This the most potent area for improvement, as it is how human players win.  Humans are able to evaluate unknown opponent pieces and make good decisions that violate worst case scenarios.  The AI deviates only slightly from worst case scenarios, but this gives it significant advantage over other bots which rely on worst case scenarios and completely miss how the AI can obliterate the opponent's pieces without the pieces clearly known.  Yet against a skilled human opponent, the AI is a patsy. Why?  Because humans much more easily guess the rank of the opponent unknown pieces.  This human ability needs to be distilled into algorithms that gives the AI the same advantage.

V. de Boer advocates a probabilistic approach, which each piece assigned a probability for each the 12 ranks that it might be.  The probabilities are adjusted based on piece movements such as when opponent pieces migrate away from or towards areas of known player pieces.  Some simple setup information is also considered, such as the Spy is favored to be adjacent or behind the opponent General. This strategy is complicated by bluffing, as unknown lesser pieces then can bluff and push superior pieces into the arms of waiting attackers.

Demon Of Ignorance saves history about piece encounters factually, not probabilistically.  For example, when an piece approaches a opposing piece, the encounter is recorded, and the approaching piece is assigned a chase rank.  Similarly, if a piece flees an opposing piece, the fleeing piece is assigned a flee rank.  The question then becomes how to use this recorded information in the heuristic, because chasers can bluff and superior fleers can flee to avoid discovery.  But it is important that the event does not degrade or be expunged by subsequent piece movements.

To reduce the effect of bluffing,
it is imperative that when evaluating the risk and reward of an attack
(perhaps on a known opponent piece that was recently discovered),
assumptions must be made about the opponent setup,
and the attack must then be executed fully, ignoring opponent unknown piece attempts at rebuff.

The Stratego bot Probe 2 makes guesses about the opponent setup,
favoring the Marshal and General to attack unknown unmoved pieces on the front row below the lakes(aka "lottoing").
This strategy, once discovered, allows a player to place bombs below the lakes
and win Probe's Marshal and General in a high percentage of games.  Yet it demonstrates the correct approach: formulate an attack based on risk and reward, and stick to it.  However,  Probe suffers from susceptibility to bluffing by any piece. Thus any unknown chaser is assumed to be of superior rank, and the opponent can push Probe's superior pieces at will.

Probe 2 is also frequently successful at identifying the opponent location of the flag, perhaps by looking at setup information or pattern matching.

##  Plans.
A plan is a concept for material or positional gain that is difficult to prove computationally (because of limited search depth), but a skilled player would recognize as having some chance at success.
Plans are generated statically before move generation by the oracle, and then minimax dynamically computes the move having the best combination of material exchange and plan value.
Indeed,
because moves that actually win material are rare during the game,
most moves are chosen based on minimaxing plan value.

There are very few plans.
1. Approach opponent pieces that that could result in a favorable exchange.
2. Attack opponent flag structures.
3. Defend its flag.
4. Determine opponent piece ranks through bluffing or baiting.
5. Control the lanes.
6. Directed Forays

A problem with most bots is they lack any sense of offense beyond
incessantly chasing known pieces
and blithely crashing into unknown unmoved pieces.
This makes them pretty boring for most humans to play.
Offense needs to be carefully directed to achieve some purpose
because statistically, random forays lead to loss of material if the
opponent has strategically placed his pieces for defense.

Demon of Ignorance analyzes its pieces at the start of the game
and chooses one of the three lanes to mount an attack,
hoping to either find a flag structure or make it to the rear of the board
so that it can attack pieces on the rear that are statistically weak
and eventually make it to the flag structure.

##  Static position analysis
Stratego using brute force requires pre-processing because it is difficult to obtain the search depths that would render it obsolete.  The simple maze running approach has severe limitations and should be replaced by forward pruning and deep search.  Once the goal for a piece has been established, the move sequence can be determined by selecting only that piece and neighboring pieces on its journey in a deep tree search.  Ideally, these chases could be run in parallel on separate threads while the broad search continues on the main thread, taking advantage of today's multiple core hardware.  It is probably only a matter of time until superior algorithms such as those used in the Google Deepmind AlphaZero chess engine make this approach obsolete.
## Performance Tuning
Use perf and perf-map-agent to locate hotspots.
## Setups
Many of the initial setups, especially the non-bombed setups are ridiculous.  If you encounter one of these setups, remove the line from resource/ai.cfg.  Better yet, run an automated test against the AI evaluator and remove the setups that lose badly.  Another idea: design an automated test using just the bad setups and improve the ai win ratio with just bad setups.  (You can find the one that was used in the first line of ai.out.)
## Opponent bots
Improve or add opponent bots in 
[Stratego AI Evaluator](https://github.com/braathwaate/strategoevaluator).
## Add AI player to TCP/IP server.
The Stratego server supports two person play over TCP/IP.  Currently it does not support playing the AI over TCP/IP.  The AI player should be added to the Lobby so that any player can play the AI over TCP/IP.   The server will need to fork the AI player upon player request.  Add a new View object (like the AITest object) to create an AI client for TCP/IP play.

# AI Regression Testing

Demon Of Ignorance supports the interface protocol defined in
[Stratego AI Evaluator](https://github.com/braathwaate/strategoevaluator).
This is used to test the strength of the AI
by playing the AI against the bots including itself and the prior release.
To use Demon Of Ignorance with the Stratego AI Evaluator,
use the -t option on the command line.

For a given set of initial setups,
each new version of the AI must result in 100% wins against the agents.
In addition, the number of moves to reach the win
are totaled.
The sum of the number of moves for all the games played against each agent
must be equal or less than that recorded by the prior AI code.
In other words,
while a modified AI may take more moves to win any individual game
(and it must win all games against all agents),
the aggregate of all moves to win a set of games must be less.
Finally, a new release must win a majority of games against the prior release.

It would also be useful to have a suite of test positions.
This would require the AI to read in a position with both unknown
and revealed pieces.
